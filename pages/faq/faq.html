                        It's simple: 1) You submit your property information through our online form. 2) We evaluate your property and make you a fair cash offer within 24 hours. 3) If you accept, we schedule a closing date that works for you and handle all the paperwork. You can close in as little as 7 days and receive cash payment.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        No! Unlike traditional real estate sales, there are zero fees, no realtor commissions (typically 6%), and no closing costs. We cover all of these expenses. The cash offer we make is the amount you receive.

                        We buy houses in ANY condition - from pristine to properties needing major repairs. You don't need to clean, repair, paint, or stage anything. We buy houses as-is, which means you save money and time on repairs and maintenance.

                        We typically provide cash offers within 24 hours of receiving your property information. In urgent situations, we can often provide an offer even faster - sometimes within a few hours.

                        Absolutely! Our cash offers are 100% no-obligation. You can take time to review the offer, compare it with other options, and make the decision that's best for you. There's no pressure to accept.

                        We can close in as little as 7 days if you need to sell quickly. However, we're flexible and can work with your timeline. If you need 30, 60, or even 90 days, we can accommodate that too. You choose the closing date that works best for you.

                        After you submit your property details, our team will review the information and may reach out with a few follow-up questions.

                        In most cases, yes, you'll need to sign the closing documents. However, if you're unable to attend in person, we can arrange for remote signing or use a power of attorney in certain situations. We're flexible and will work with your circumstances.

                        We base our offers on several factors: current market value, property condition, location, recent comparable sales in your area, and necessary repairs.

                        Our cash offers reflect the convenience and speed we provide. While we make competitive offers, they may be slightly below retail market value because we buy as-is (saving you repair costs), pay all closing costs, and eliminate agent commissions (typically 6%). When you add up these savings, many sellers find our offers very fair.
